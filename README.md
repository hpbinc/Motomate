# Motomate

This application is done for Exofleet Inc. as my mini project. The application is developed based on sensor fusion algorithm integrating smart phone sensors including accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS. The app measures the gravity free velocity measurement of lateral and longitudinal velocity along the vehicle axis. With this application the company could distinguish between normal and reckless driving behaviour of the user. The application can also detect the accident and notifies the concerned.
